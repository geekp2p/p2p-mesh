# Project Checklist

## âœ… Completed
- [x] Connect to multiple relays with automatic reconnection  
  Ensures a node rotates through provided relay addresses if a relay disconnects.
- [x] Announce and update public nodes in the DHT for automatic bootstrapping  

## ðŸš§ In Progress / To Do
- [ ] Implement a watchdog to detect peer disconnects and attempt reconnection  
- [ ] Broadcast online relay lists via gossipsub so peers learn new relays quickly  
- [ ] Add a retry schedule to recover the network when all peers have disconnected  
- [ ] Design auto-relay fallback so private nodes can reconnect through any available public node  
- [ ] Persist known multiaddresses so nodes can rediscover each other after downtime  
- [ ] Document the above mechanisms and provide deployment examples
