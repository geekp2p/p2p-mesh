# p2p-mesh
Peer-to-peer mesh networking toolkit in Go, containerized with Docker.   Supports LAN discovery (mDNS), NAT traversal (UPnP, hole punching, AutoNAT),   and optional Circuit Relay v2 fallback for guaranteed connectivity.   Each node has a unique peer ID and can auto-discover peers without a central server.
