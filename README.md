# p2p-mesh

A peer-to-peer mesh networking project written in Go and containerized with Docker.
Each node runs independently with a persistent unique PeerID and can discover peers automatically on LAN or over the internet.
The system is serverless by design, with optional relay support for guaranteed connectivity behind restrictive NATs.

## âœ¨ Features
- âœ… Unique peer IDs (Ed25519, persisted in volume)
- âœ… LAN discovery using mDNS
- âœ… NAT traversal with AutoNAT, UPnP, NAT-PMP, and hole punching (DCUtR)
- âœ… GossipSub pub/sub messaging between peers
- âœ… Optional Circuit Relay v2 for guaranteed connectivity
- âœ… Docker Compose setup for easy multi-node deployment

## ðŸ“¦ Quick Start

Clone and run two local nodes in Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geekp2p/p2p-mesh.git
cd p2p-mesh
docker compose up --build
```

## ðŸ›  Manual Build

### Node

```bash
cd node
go build -o p2p-node .
./p2p-node
```

### Relay

```bash
cd relay
go build -o p2p-relay .
./p2p-relay
```
